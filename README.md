# block_em_up

What's the point of this app? Nothing. The only thing it'll do is block every number that starts with the number or numbers you specify.

Still want to use it? Sure. Find the ```.apk``` file from the folder with the newest date [here](https://github.com/SuhasBharadwajK/block_em_up/tree/master/apk), download it into your Android device and install it. And yes, it's only for Android because iOS is for losers anyway.

This could be quite dangerous if you specify a single digit and leave it be. Every incoming call from a number starting with that number will be rejected. On the plus side, you'll lose all your friends.
